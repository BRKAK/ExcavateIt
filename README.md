This is a senior project done in 2022-2023. This project is a VR standalone simulation for those who are interested in excavator functionalities. Every control is coded based on the real life controls of excavators. All the models and VR implementations were done by me. This project uses Unity XR Plugin but the built-in functionalities were not enough. Source code includes manipulation of built-in libraries to satisfy specific requirements. Active script that has these data manipulations is called "ExcavatorMovement" under V3.3 folder FYI.
